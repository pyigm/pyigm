 - Density profile of Faerman et al.

profiles_M12_eta2.npz 
 - Density profile from Fielding+17
 
stern18_Mhalo_12.0.npz
 - Density profile from Stern+18
 - This is the baryon density and temperature for the model described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05446, where the accretion shock is at 0.5 R_vir. Densities are 
 scaled to the COS-Halos redshift of z=0.2.
